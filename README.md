🚀 OVERVIEW 

The AI CyberSafe Checker is an AI-powered phishing and scam detection tool designed to help users identify fraudulent messages, emails, and websites before they fall victim to cyberattacks.

It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformer-based models to analyze text content in real time and determine whether it is safe or malicious, helping individuals and small businesses build digital resilience in today’s cyber-threat landscape.


🎯 PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Millions of Nigerians and global internet users lose data and money every year to phishing, fake investment schemes, and online scams.
